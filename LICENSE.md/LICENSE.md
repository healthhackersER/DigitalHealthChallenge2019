Digital Health Challenge – Terms of participation

Preface
The participant accepts these Terms for Participation by the registration to the Hackathon via Eventbrite. The Terms for Participation are subject to the law of Germany.
Behaviour Policy – Be excellent to each other
All attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff at our hackathon are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.
Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous hackathon attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned).
We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any hackathon venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media. Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.

Privacy Policy
The information provided by the participants during registration process and event will be strictly saved for communication purposes between participants and organisers. We respect your privacy and protect your personal information thus will never share, rent, sell or trade it.

Intellectual Property Policy
Any submission during the Hackathon of the Digital Health Challenge remains the property of those individuals who created it. The organisation and its affiliates claim no ownership of content or submissions during the Hackathon. Nevertheless, as created knowledge should not belong exclusively to anyone and everyone should be able to continue working even if someone drops out of the challenge, each participant grants a non-exclusive right to the other Hackathon participants to use such created knowledge for purposes of the Hackathon and the Community Challenges.
By submitting a pitch or accepting any prize, Hackers warrant that they will not submit content that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret, or subject to third-party intellectual property/other proprietary rights including privacy and publicity rights. That is, unless you are the rightful owner or have been granted explicit permission. Participants will not submit any misrepresentations or falsehoods that could damage the Hackathon or its affiliates.
If participants are using any preliminary work, it should be disclaimed in proper manner for example by a footnote in the pitch deck (e.g. in case of use of an open source framework or rightfully licensed or self-developed software). This should embrace the knowledge sharing aspect at the hackathon and serve the overall fairness and a better comparability of outcomes. The jury is focused on what has been accomplished during the time of the hackathon.

Startup Policy
Startups are highly welcomed to participate in the hackathon both actively as participants / teams and / or mentor. Nevertheless, we embrace a community spirit, so we ask startup teams kindly to be open for other participants to join in their hackathon team. The team constellation will be a judgment criterion. Furthermore, we highlight our Intellectual Property Policy which includes that startups can work with their preliminary work, however, have to disclose it accordingly.
If any startup is interested in providing technology or provide mentoring capacities, please do not hesitate to get in touch with us: jonas.jung@medical-valley-emn.de
